# Hello Hackers
This module teaches the very basics of interacting with the command line. As it is an introductory module, the challenges are quite simple to solve.

### 1. Intro to Commands:
This challenge serves as an introduction to commands on the command line. The task is to simply invoke the *hello* command to get the flag.
>**Flag**: pwn.college{knOJ7-vtG-nvU_uhn4OM6n_BfSI.ddjNyUDL3ADM1czW}

### 2. Intro to Arguments:
An argument is additional data passed to the command. The shell parses input into a command and its arguments. The challenge is to run the *hello* command with the argument *hackers*.
>**Flag**: pwn.college{gC42xlrKuYW5cLUBTSv_UJ96Aa0.dhjNyUDL3ADM1czW}
